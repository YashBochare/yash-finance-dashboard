# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals
*   **Mathematical Integrity:** Implement a zero-error calculation engine using integer-based math (cents) for all financial totals.
*   **Premium Visual Experience:** Adhere to a strict 8px spacing system and a "Dark Graphite" color palette to create a professional, calm fintech environment.
*   **Local Sovereignty:** Ensure 100% of user data remains on the device via `localStorage`, providing privacy and offline availability.
*   **Instant Feedback:** Achieve sub-50ms dashboard recalculations (Stats & Charts) whenever data is modified.
*   **Structural Clarity:** Maintain a rigid UI hierarchy with a fixed sidebar and responsive grid that scales from desktop to mobile.

## 1.2 Background Context
**Yash-Finance** fill the gap between complex, cloud-synced applications and over-simplified lists. It is a "local-first" dashboard that feels like a premium banking application but functions as a private, standalone tool. By focusing on a minimal yet high-fidelity aesthetic, the application aims to reduce "financial anxiety" through precision and structural harmony.
